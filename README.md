# AIRLINE-FARE-SELECTION-BEHAVIOUR-ANALYSIS

## PROJECT OVERVIEW
 This analysis examines Airline passenger fare selection patterns to evaluate the effectiveness of the airline’s upsell strategy. It explores how factors such as trip type, device category, and traveller group influence customers’ decisions to upgrade from the default fare to higher-priced options. The goal is to identify behavioral trends, measure upsell conversion performance, and uncover opportunities to optimize pricing, targeting, and revenue growth.

### DATA SOURCES

Airline_fare Upsell performance Data : The Primary dataset used for the analysis is the Airline_Fare_Upsell_performance.xlsx file containing the major data for the analysis.

### Tools

- MS SQL Server - Data cleaning,Data Analysis
- PowerBI - Creating Report & Dashboard

### Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the begining stage,I performed the following task:
1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Checking and Handling missing values
3. Checking and Handling duplicates

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer the main questions, like:
- What percentage of customers accept an upsell versus the default fare?
- Which trip type (one-way vs round-trip) is more likely to upgrade?
- Which traveller group (solo, couple, small group, large_group) upgrades the most?
- How does device type (mobile, desktop, tablet) affect upsell acceptance?
- Which fare option (Option 1, 2, or 3) is chosen most often?

### RESULTS/FINDINGS

The analysis results are summarized below:
1. The current upsell strategy is working above average, with more than half of customers choosing an upgrade.
2. 55% of passengers accepted an upgrade, while 44% stayed with the default fare – showing strong upsell potential.
3. Option 3 recorded the lowest upgrade rate, suggesting that customers either find it too expensive or do not clearly perceive enough value to justify the higher price
4. One-way trip travellers were more likely to upgrade than round-trip travellers.
5. Solo travellers upgraded more frequently than couples or group travellers.
6. Passengers showed clear interest in mid-value option (Option 2) when upgrading.
7. Desktop users were more likely to upgrade compared to Mobile users, suggesting better engagement on Desktop
8. Organic Search is the strongest revenue-driving channel and higher upgrade,indicating that customers arriving through search already have strong intent and are more receptive to premium offers

### RECOMMENDATION

1. Since Desktop users upgrade more often, optimize Desktop UX with clearer value messaging, fewer clicks, and well-timed pop-ups.
2. Target one-way and solo travelers
3. Create personalized upgrade prompts for one-way trips and solo bookings, as they show the highest upgrade tendency.
4. Strengthen Option 2 visibilityand highlight the benefits mid-value options more clearly (e.g., “Most Popular,” “Best Value”) to encourage premium selection
5. Revise Option 3 pricing and highlight added value through benefits like greater flexibility and priority services
6. Increase investment organic content strategy to attract more high-intent travelers.
